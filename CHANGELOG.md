# Changelog

## v0.2.3

- Added automatic episode metadata inference when choosing an episode folder or master video.
- Review packets now resolve project IDs and titles from real folder/master names instead of falling back to `VID-0000` and the untitled placeholder.
- Added a compact review-header metadata line so reviewers can verify the active episode, title, and loaded master before submitting notes.
- Review timecodes now use the loaded master video's detected frame rate and export that frame-rate metadata in review packets.

## v0.2.2

- Replaced the app icon with a premium, non-branded classic 35mm motion-picture camera icon.
- Added the 1024px app icon source asset for future iconset regeneration.

## v0.2.1

- Updated trim-start and trim-end marks so the parked playhead time pre-populates the trim `In` point.
- Trim `Out` now stays blank until the reviewer sets it manually.
- Added premium submit feedback: success color, checkmark state, subtle animation, and confirmation copy after revision packet submission.
